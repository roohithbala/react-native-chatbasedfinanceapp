# Edit Profile & Media Permissions Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Edit Profile Not Working**
**Problem**: Clicking "Edit Profile" in Account section did nothing
**Root Cause**: The handleMenuAction was navigating to `/profile?edit=true` but the modal state was never updated
**Fix Applied**: 
- Moved `handleMenuAction` logic directly into profile.tsx
- Now directly calls `setShowEditProfileModal(true)` when Edit Profile is clicked
- Added useEffect to handle query parameter for backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added handleMenuAction inline, opens modal directly
- ‚úÖ `app/hooks/useProfileActions.ts` - Removed unused handleMenuAction export

### 2. **Media Permissions Failing**
**Problem**: Voice/video calls fail with "Permissions not granted" error
**Root Cause**: 
- expo-camera and expo-av require native code integration
- These modules don't work in Expo Go
- Requires development build with `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios`

**Fix Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Updated app.json with camera/audio plugins (already done)
- ‚úÖ Improved MediaManager error messages to explain the issue
- ‚úÖ Updated voice/video call error alerts to guide users
- ‚úÖ Added clear diagnostic messages in console logs

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `lib/services/MediaManager.ts` - Better error messages and diagnostics
- ‚úÖ `app/voice-call/[userId].tsx` - User-friendly error explaining development build requirement
- ‚úÖ `app/video-call/[userId].tsx` - User-friendly error explaining development build requirement

## üöÄ Testing Edit Profile

### Steps to Test:
1. **Open app** and navigate to Profile tab
2. **Scroll down** to Account section
3. **Tap "Edit Profile"**
4. **Edit Profile modal should open immediately** ‚úÖ
5. Make changes to name, email, username, UPI ID, etc.
6. Tap "Save"
7. Changes should save and modal should close

### What Was Fixed:
- **Before**: Tapping Edit Profile did nothing or navigated causing reload
- **After**: Tapping Edit Profile immediately opens modal inline

## üé• Voice/Video Calls - Important Information

### Why Calls Aren't Working in Expo Go

**Expo Go Limitations**:
- Expo Go is a sandbox app that runs on your device
- It includes common Expo modules but NOT all native modules
- `expo-camera` and `expo-av` require native code that Expo Go doesn't include
- These permissions can only work in a **development build**

### How to Enable Voice/Video Calls

You have **two options**:

#### **Option 1: Development Build (Recommended for Full Features)**

```bash
# 1. Stop current Expo Go server
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal

# 2. Clear Metro cache
cd d:\Chatbasedfinance\react-native-chatbasedfinanceapp
npx expo start -c

# 3. Create native projects
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 4. Build and run on device/emulator
# For Android:
npx expo run:android

# For iOS:
npx expo run:ios
```

**What this does**:
- Creates native Android/iOS projects
- Compiles app with all native modules included
- Installs on your device/emulator with full permissions support
- Camera and microphone permissions will work properly

**Requirements**:
- Android Studio installed (for Android)
- Xcode installed (for iOS, Mac only)
- Physical device or emulator connected

#### **Option 2: Continue with Expo Go (Limited Features)**

If you don't need voice/video calls right now:
- All other features work perfectly in Expo Go
- Edit profile ‚úÖ
- Expenses tracking ‚úÖ
- Split bills ‚úÖ
- Groups ‚úÖ
- Insights ‚úÖ
- Chat ‚úÖ

Voice/video calls will show a helpful error message explaining they need a development build.

## üì± Current Error Messages

### Voice Call Error:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Voice calls require microphone permissions.

This feature needs a development build. Please run:

1. npx expo prebuild --clean
2. npx expo run:android (or run:ios)

```

### Video Call Error:
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This may be due to:
   1. Modules not properly installed (run: npx expo install expo-camera expo-av)
   2. App.json plugins not configured
   3. Native build required after config changes (run: npx expo prebuild --clean)
   4. Metro cache needs clearing (run: npx expo start -c)
‚ö†Ô∏è For Expo Go, voice/video calls require a development build.
